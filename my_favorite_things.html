        <p>Honkai: Star Rail is a free-to-play role-playing gacha video game developed and published by miHoYo.
           The game features the main character, who is referred to as the Trailblazer, traveling across planets
           through the Astral Express to help and connect the worlds while resolving disasters caused by "Stellarons" and other third parties.
           The first closed beta test was launched on October 27, 2021. It was publicly released internationally on April 26, 2023 for Windows and mobile devices</p>

        <p>Bad Apple!! is the sixth track in the soundtrack of the 1998 shoot 'em up video game Lotus Land Story,
           the fourth entry in the Touhou Project series created by Team Shanghai Alice, and is composed by ZUN.<br>
           It is notable for leading to a much later cover by Alstroemeria Records and a subsequent accompanying black-and-white shadow puppet-video commonly called Shadow-art.
           The video became a Japanese internet meme in the late 2000s, correlating with the peak of Touhou's popularity,
           and experienced a resurgence in the mid-2010s when the black-and-white video was ported to esoteric media such as obsolete hardware, displays created within sandbox video games (e.g. Minecraft), and other unusual media (such as a mechanical television) as a graphical test.
